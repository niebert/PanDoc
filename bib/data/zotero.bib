	abstract = {Open complex agent systems {(OCAS)} are becoming increasingly important in constructing problem-solving systems for enterprise applications. are challenging because they present very high system complexities involving human users and interactions with a changing environment. The existing agent-oriented software engineering {(AOSE)} approaches have trouble in engineering {OCAS} because of a number of deficiencies, e.g., lacking the capability of handling system dynamics analysis. This paper introduces an effective {AOSE} approach, i.e., organization- and service-oriented system analysis and design {(OSOAD).} It is used to extract and model system members and design a real-life {OCAS} system called financial trading rule automated development and evaluation {(F-Trade).} Through the case studies of visual and formal modeling and design of major organizational members, relations, and subsystems in {F-Trade}, this paper demonstrates the effective mechanisms and capabilities of the {OSOAD} approach. System implementation and evaluation results further show that {OSOAD} provides comprehensive {AOSE} support for engineering real-world open complex agent organizations.},
