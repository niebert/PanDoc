	abstract = {This paper describes the design and development of a location-based Augmented Reality (AR) application for mobile devices. The application provides real time data about transportation in a urban area. It can be set along the line of the continuous creation of richer and more complex interaction modalities between users and data. A relevant element in this strategy is the visual enrichment of the real scene perceived though the mobile camera, by superimposing to it a set of user-relevant information. In the presented work, this information is related to nearby bus stops and to the arrival of next buses. More details, such as routes, distances etc. can be displayed on demand in order to gain awareness of the surrounding infomobility data. The presented application is included in a multiservice framework named RMob, developed for the city of Rome.},

We discuss the benefits and limitations of stakeholder engagement in flood risk management decisions before highlighting some of the technical aspects of developing such an approach. We then examine how stakeholder access to mapping and spatial policies offers the potential for improved stakeholder dialogue and involvement in flood risk management. The paper highlights some of the underlying principles of the approach, potential pitfalls that the policy making community should avoid and good practice approaches to developing a participatory approach within flood risk management.},

	abstract = {New human cases of tick borne encephalitis (TBE) have recently been recorded outside the recognized foci of this disease, i.e. in the province of Trento in northern Italy. In order to predict the highest risk areas for increased tick-borne encephalitis virus activity, we have combined cross-sectional serological data, obtained from 459 domestic goats, with analysis of the autumnal cooling rate based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) data. A significant relationship between finding antibodies against the virus in serum (seroprevalence) in goats and the autumnal cooling rate was detected, indicating that the transmission intensity of the virus does not only vary spatially, but also in relation to climatic factors. Virus seroprevalence in goats was correlated with the occurrence of tick-borne encephalitis in humans and also with the average number of forestry workers' tick bites, demonstrating that serological screening of domestic animals, combined with an analysis of the autumnal cooling rate, can be used as early-warning predictors of tick-borne encephalitis risk in humans.},

	abstract = {R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT\&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.

R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.

One of R's strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control.

R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public License in source code form. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS.},

Ticks were pooled for analyses and from 1060 pools of ticks collected in the province of Belluno and 12390 tick samples collected in Trentino, four proved positive by immunofluorescence microscopy using a tick-borne encephalitis (TBE)-specific antiserum. The identity of the virus isolates was determined by RT-PCR cycle sequencing and they were all found to be closely similar ({\textgreater} 98\% nucleotide identity) to typical western European TBE complex viruses as found in Austria. The isolates from Trentino differed from the Neudorfl strain of western European TBE virus at eight nucleotide positions but as these nucleotide substitutions were all synonymous, there were no amino acid changes. These results imply that the virus isolates in Trentino have changed slightly from the typical European strains isolated in nearby Austria. The abundance of questing ticks and ticks feeding on roe deer was greater in TBE positive hunting districts than in hunting districts where TBE complex viruses were only probable or believed to be absent. In TBE positive and probable districts synchrony in the seasonal dynamics of larvae and nymphs of L. ricinus was observed. This study provides evidence to suggest that roe deer may have an important role to play in the maintenance of tick density and in the persistence of TBE virus.},

	abstract = {Ecological studies are based on characteristics of groups of individuals, which are common in various disciplines including epidemiology. It is of great interest for epidemiologists to study the geographical variation of a disease by accounting for the positive spatial dependence between neighbouring areas. However, the choice of scale of the spatial correlation requires much attention. In view of a lack of studies in this area, this study aims to investigate the impact of differing definitions of geographical scales using a multilevel model. We propose a new approach – the grid-based partitions and compare it with the popular census region approach. Unexplained geographical variation is accounted for via area-specific unstructured random effects and spatially structured random effects specified as an intrinsic conditional autoregressive process. Using grid-based modelling of random effects in contrast to the census region approach, we illustrate conditions where improvements are observed in the estimation of the linear predictor, random effects, parameters, and the identification of the distribution of residual risk and the aggregate risk in a study region. The study has found that grid-based modelling is a valuable approach for spatially sparse data while the statistical local area-based and grid-based approaches perform equally well for spatially dense data.},

The re-emergence of CHIKV has also resulted in numerous outbreaks in several countries in the eastern hemisphere, with a threat to further expand in the near future. However, there is no vaccine against CHIKV infection licensed for human use, and therapy for CHIKV infection is still mainly limited to supportive care as antiviral agents are yet in different stages of testing or development. In this review we explore the different perspectives for chikungunya treatment and the effectiveness of these treatment regimens and discuss the scope for future directions.},

To examine adoption of telehealth in a rural public health district and to explain how the innovation became sustainable.

Study Setting
Longitudinal, qualitative study (1988–2008) of the largest public health district in Georgia.

Study Design
Case study design provided deep insights into the innovation's social dynamics. Punctuated equilibrium theory helped present and make sense of the process. We identified antecedent conditions and outcomes, and we distinguished between episodes and encounters based on the disruptive effects of events.

Data Collection
Twenty-five semistructured interviews with 19 decision makers and professionals, direct observations, published papers, grant proposals, technical specifications, and other written materials.

Principal Findings
Strong collaboration within the district, with local community, and with external partners energized the process. Well-functioning outreach clinics made telehealth desirable. Local champions cultivated participation and generative capability, and overcame barriers through opportunistic exploitation of technological and financial options. Telehealth usage fluctuated between medical and administrative operations in response to internal needs and contextual dynamics. External agencies provided initial funding and supported later expansion.

Conclusions
Extensive internal and external collaboration, and a combination of technology push and opportunistic exploitation, can enable sustainable rural telehealth innovation.},

	url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0004336},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Western Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus often causes devastating or lethal disease. In Europe, the number of human TBE cases has increased dramatically over the last decade, risk areas are expanding and new foci are being discovered every year. The early localisation of new TBE foci and the identification of the main risk factors associated with disease emergence represent a priority for the public health community. Although a number of socio-economic parameters have been suggested to explain TBE upsurges in eastern Europe, the principal driving factors in relatively stable western European countries have not been identified. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this paper, we analyse the correlation between the upsurge of TBE in 17 alpine provinces in northern Italy from 1992 to 2006 with climatic variables, forest structure (as a proxy for small mammal reservoir host abundance), and abundance of the principal large vertebrate tick host (roe deer), using datasets available for the last 40 years. No significant differences between the pattern of changes in climatic variables in provinces where TBE has emerged compared to provinces were no clinical TBE cases have been observed to date. Instead, the best model for explaining the increase in TBE incidence in humans in this area include changes in forest structure, in particular the ratio of coppice to high stand forest, and the density of roe deer. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Substantial changes in vegetation structure that improve habitat suitability for the main TBE reservoir hosts (small mammals), as well as an increase in roe deer abundance due to changes in land and wildlife management practices, are likely to be among the most crucial factors affecting the circulation potential of Western TBE virus and, consequently, the risk of TBE emergence in humans in western Europe. We believe our approach will be useful in predicting TBE risk on a wider scale.},

The effects of these agents may be modulated by genetic susceptibility and other comorbid conditions and may lead to the development of acute and CKD. In this article, we present environmental factors that are associated with CKD.},

	abstract = {Roe deer Capreolus capreolus are among the most important feeding hosts for the sheep tick Ixodes ricinus, thus contributing to the occurrence of tick-borne diseases in Europe. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), which is transmitted by co-feeding of larvae and nymphs on rodents, requires precise climatic conditions to occur. We used roe deer as sentinels for potential circulation of TBE virus in Northern Italy, by examining the association between tick infestation, occurrence of TBE human cases, geographical and climatic parameters. Tick infestation on roe deer, and particularly frequency of co-feeding, was clearly associated with the geographic location and the autumnal cooling rate. Consistently, TBE occurrence in humans was geographically related to co-feeding tick abundance. The surveillance of tick infestation on roe deer, combined with remotely sensed climatic data, could therefore be used as an inexpensive early risk assessment tool of favourable conditions for TBE emergence and persistence in humans.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In El Salvador, end-stage renal disease is the leading cause of hospital deaths in adults, the second cause of death in men and the fifth leading cause of death in adults of both sexes in the general population.
OBJECTIVE: Identify risk factors for chronic kidney disease and urinary markers of renal and vascular damage, measure kidney function and characterize prevalence of chronic kidney disease in persons aged ≥18 years in the Bajo Lempa region of El Salvador.
METHODS: A cross-sectional analytical epidemiological study was carried out using active screening for chronic kidney disease and associated risk factors in individuals aged ≥18 years in the Bajo Lempa Region, a rural, coastal area in El Salvador. Door-to-door visits and clinical examinations were conducted. Epidemiological and clinical data were collected including: family and personal clinical history of disease; biological, behavioral, social and environmental risk factors; physical measurements; urinalysis for markers of renal and vascular damage; and blood tests (serum creatinine, serum glucose, lipid profile). Glomerular filtration rate was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. Chronic kidney disease case confirmation was done three months later. Multiple logistic regression was used for data analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 375 families and 775 individuals (343 men, 432 women) were studied-88.3\% of the total resident population in the region. Elevated prevalence of risk factors was observed: diabetes mellitus, 10.3\%; hypertension,16.9\%; family history of chronic kidney disease, 21.6\%; dyslipidemias, 63.1\%; overweight, 34\%; obesity, 22.4\%; metabolic syndrome, 28.8\%; use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 74.8\%; infectious diseases, 86.9\%; agricultural occupation, 40.6\% (80.6\% in men); and contact with agrochemicals, 50.3\% (82.5\% in men). Prevalence renal damage markers was 15.8\% (greater in men): microalbuminuria 6.3\%; proteinuria 5.7\%; hematuria 3.5\%; proteinuria-hematuria 0.3\%. Proteinuria of {\textless}1 g/L predominated. Prevalence of chronic kidney disease was 17.9\% (25.7\% in men; 11.8\% in women). Distribution by stages: stage 1, 4.6\%; stage 2, 3.5\%; stage 3, 6.2\%; stage 4, 3.0\%; stage 5, 0.6\%. In patients with chronic kidney disease, most common was non-diabetic chronic kidney disease (86.3\%), followed by chronic kidney disease associated with neither diabetes nor hypertension (54.7\%). Prevalence of chronic renal failure was 9.8\% (17\% in men; 4.1\% in women). Multiple logistic regression showed significant association with increasing age, male sex, hypertension and family history of chronic kidney disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated prevalence of chronic kidney disease, chronic renal failure and risk factors was found, compared to international reports. Most common was chronic kidney disease of unknown cause, associated with neither diabetes nor hypertension. Associations were found with age, male sex, hypertension and family history of chronic kidney disease, with decline in kidney function beginning at early ages. Male farmers have a dual burden of non traditional (occupational, toxic environmental) and traditional (vascular) risk factors that could act in synergy, contributing to kidney damage.},

	abstract = {Having analyzed the current status and existing problems of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) applications in epidemiology, this chapter proposes a method to establish a spatial decision support system (SDSS) for the prevention of epidemic diseases by integrating the COM GIS, spatial database, gps, remote sensing, and communication technologies, as well as ASP and ActiveX software development technologies. One important issue in constructing the SDSS for epidemic disease prevention concerns the incorporation of epidemic spread models in a GIS. The chapter begins with a description of the capabilities of GIS in epidemic prevention. Some established models of an epidemic spread are studied to extract essential computational parameters. A technical schema is then proposed to integrate epidemic models using a GIS and relevant geospatial technologies. The GIS and modeling platforms share a common spatial database and the modeled results can be visualized spatially by desktop and Web clients. A complete solution for establishing the SDSS for epidemic disease prevention based on the model integrating methods and the ArcGIS software is suggested in this chapter. The proposed SDSS comprises several sub-systems: data acquisition, network communication, model integration, epidemic disease information spatial database, epidemic disease information query and statistical analysis, epidemic disease dynamic surveillance, epidemic disease information spatial analysis and decision support, as well as epidemic disease information publishing based on the Web GIS technology. The design process and sample VC and VB programming codes of the epidemic case precaution are used as an example to illustrate the basic principles and methods of the system development that integrates GIS functions with models of epidemic spread. A case study of AIDS in the Yunnan Province of China exemplifies the systems spatial analytical functions through its spatial database access and statistical analysis tools.},

	abstract = {The risk of exposure to Lyme disease in the province of Trento, Italian Alps, was predicted through the analysis of the distribution of Ixodes ricinus (L.) nymphs infected with Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. with a model based on bootstrap aggregation (bagging) of tree-based classifiers within a geographical information system (GIS). Data on L ricinus density assessed by dragging the vegetation in 438 sites during 1996 were cross-correlated with the digital cartography of a GIS, which included the variables altitude, exposure and slope, substratum, vegetation type and roe deer density. Ticks were more abundant at altitudes below 1,300 m a.s.l., in the presence of limestone and vegetation cover with thermophile deciduous forests and high densities of roe deer. A bootstrap aggregation procedure (bagging) was used to produce a model for the prediction of tick occurrence, the accuracy of which was tested on actual tick counts assessed by a further dragging campaign carried out during 1997 to determine infection prevalence and resulted in average 77\%. Other tests of the model were made on additional and independent data sets. The prevalence of infection with Borrelia burgdorferi s.l, determined by polymerase chain reaction on 2,208 nymphs collected by random dragging in 245 transects selected within eight areas where the model predicted the occurrence of I. ricinus during 1997, was 17.5\% and was positively correlated to tick abundance and roe deer density. These findings were used to relate the output of the bagged model (probability of tick occurrence) to the density of infected nymphs through a stepwise model selection procedure and thus to produce a GIS digital map of the probability distribution of infected nymphs in the Province of Trento at high resolution scale (50 by 50-m cell resolution). The application of the bagging procedure increased the accuracy of the prediction made by a single classification tree, a well-known classification method for the analysis of epidemiological data.},

	abstract = {The tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus), vector of several emerging diseases, is expanding into more northerly latitudes as well as into higher altitudes in northern Italy. Changes in the pattern of distribution of the tiger mosquito may affect the potential spread of infectious diseases transmitted by this species in Europe. Therefore, predicting suitable areas of future establishment and spread is essential for planning early prevention and control strategies. To identify the areas currently most suitable for the occurrence of the tiger mosquito in the Province of Trento, we combined field entomological observations with analyses of satellite temperature data (MODIS Land Surface Temperature: LST) and human population data. We determine threshold conditions for the survival of overwintering eggs and for adult survival using both January mean temperatures and annual mean temperatures. We show that the 0°C LST threshold for January mean temperatures and the 11°C threshold for annual mean temperatures provide the best predictors for identifying the areas that could potentially support populations of this mosquito. In fact, human population density and distance to human settlements appear to be less important variables affecting mosquito distribution in this area. Finally, we evaluated the future establishment and spread of this species in relation to predicted climate warming by considering the A2 scenario for 2050 statistically downscaled at regional level in which winter and annual temperatures increase by 1.5 and 1°C, respectively. MODIS satellite LST data are useful for accurately predicting potential areas of tiger mosquito distribution and for revealing the range limits of this species in mountainous areas, predictions which could be extended to an European scale. We show that the observed trend of increasing temperatures due to climate change could facilitate further invasion of Ae. albopictus into new areas.},

	abstract = {The rapid propagation of vector-borne diseases, such as dengue fever, poses a threat to vulnerable populations, especially those in tropical regions. Prompt space-time analyses are critical elements for accurate outbreak detection and mitigation purposes. Open access web-based geospatial tools are particularly critical in developing countries lacking GIS software and expertise. Currently, online geospatial tools for the monitoring of surveillance data are confined to the mapping of aggregated data. In this paper, we present a web-based geospatial toolkit with a user-friendly interactive interface for the monitoring of dengue fever outbreaks, in space and time. Our geospatial toolkit is designed around the integration of (1) a spatial data management module in which epidemiologists upload spatio-temporal explicit data, (2) an analytical module running an accelerated Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to map the outbreaks of dengue fever, (3) a spatial database module to extract pairs of disease events close in space and time and (4) a GIS mapping module to visualize space-time linkages of pairs of disease events. We illustrate our approach on a set of dengue fever cases which occurred in Cali (659 geocoded cases), an urban environment in Colombia. Results indicate that dengue fever cases are significantly clustered, but the degree of intensity varies across the city. The design and implementation of the on-line toolkit underscores the benefits of the approach to monitor vector-borne disease outbreaks in a timely manner and at different scales, facilitating the appropriate allocation of resources. The toolkit is designed collaboratively with health epidemiologists and is portable for other surveillance data at the individual level such as crime or traffic accidents.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Endemic renal insufficiency (RI) of unknown etiology is a major public health issue with high mortality in the Pacific coastal regions of Central America. We studied RI in León and Chinandega, Nicaragua, evaluating associations with known risk factors and hypothesized exposures.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with assessment of medical, social, and occupational history and exposures in conjunction with measurement of serum creatinine. Cases were defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) {\textless}or=60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) using the modified four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation for non-African Americans. Logistic regression models controlling for known risk factors of kidney disease were used to evaluate associations between exposures and RI.
RESULTS: A total of 124 RI cases were compared to 873 persons without RI. Cases had no significant differences in the odds of having a systolic blood pressure (SBP) {\textgreater} 140 or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) {\textgreater} 90 mmHg, or in reporting diabetes. Agricultural labor was associated with RI (OR = 2.48, 95\%CI: 1.59, 3.89, p {\textless} 0.0001). There was no association with agricultural non-field work (OR = 0.91, 95\%CI: 0.60, 1.38, p = 0.65). Consumption of unregulated alcohol ("lija") was associated with RI (OR = 2.10, 95\%CI: 1.31, 3.39, p = 0.0023), as was drinking 5 L or more of water per day (OR = 3.59 vs. 1 L 95\%CI: 1.52, 4.46, p = 0.0035).
CONCLUSIONS: Agricultural field labor and lija consumption were associated with RI in this region. Water intake may also be important. Identifying specific risk factors for RI within these exposures, such as individual pesticides or lija ingredients, may facilitate prevention in a setting where dialysis and transplantation are limited.},

The overall hantavirus seroprevalence in the bank voles, Clethrionomys glareolus (n=229) screened for Puumala virus (PUUV) antibodies was 0.4\%, and that for Apodemus flavicollis mice (n=1416) screened for Dobrava virus (DOBV) antibodies was 0.2\%.

Of the serum samples of 488 forestry workers studied by IFA, 12 were LCMV-IgG positive (2.5\%) and one DOBV-IgG positive (0.2\%), however, the latter could not be confirmed DOBV-specific with a neutralization assay.

	abstract = {Conventional farming has led to extensive use of chemicals and, in turn, to negative environmental impacts such as soil erosion, groundwater pollution and atmosphere contamination. Farming systems should be more sustainable to reach economical and social profitability as well as environmental preservation. A possible solution is to adopt precision agriculture, a win-win option for sustaining food production without degrading the environment. Precision technologies are used for gathering information about spatial and temporal differences within the field in order to match inputs to site-specific field conditions. Here we review reports on the precision N management of wheat crop. The aims are to perform an investigation both on approaches and results of site-specific N management of wheat and to analyse performance and sustainability of this agricultural practice. In this context, we analysed literature of the last 10-15 years. The major conclusions are: (a) before making N management decisions, both the measurement and understanding of soil spatial variability and the wheat N status are needed. Complementary use of different sensors has improved soil properties assessment at relatively low cost; (b) results show the usefulness of airborne images, remote and proximal sensing for predicting crop N status by responsive in-season management approaches; (c) red edge and near-infrared bands can penetrate into higher vegetation fraction of the canopy. These narrowbands better estimated grain yield, crop N and water status, with R (2) higher than 0.70. In addition, different hyperspectral vegetation indices accounted for a high variability of 40-75 \% of wheat N status; (d) various diagnostic tools and procedures have been developed in order to help wheat farmers for planning variable N rates. In-season adjustments in N fertilizer management can account for the specific climatic conditions and yield potential since less than 30 \% of spatial variance could show temporal stability; (e) field studies in which sensor-based N management systems were compared with common farmer practices showed high increases in the N use efficiency of up to 368 \%. These systems saved N fertilizers, from 10 \% to about 80 \% less N, and reduced residual N in the soil by 30-50 \%, without either reducing yields or influencing grain quality; (f) precision N management based on real-time sensing and fertilization had the highest profitability of about \$5-60 ha(-1) compared to undifferentiated applications.},

	abstract = {Background   Telemedicine is currently mainly applied as an in-hospital service, but this technology also holds potential to improve emergency care in the prehospital arena. We report on the safety, feasibility and reliability of in-ambulance teleconsultation using a telemedicine system of the third generation.      Methods   A routine ambulance was equipped with a system for real-time bidirectional audio-video communication, automated transmission of vital parameters, glycemia and electronic patient identification. All patients ( ≥18 years) transported during emergency missions by a Prehospital Intervention Team of the Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel were eligible for inclusion. To guarantee mobility and to facilitate 24/7 availability, the teleconsultants used lightweight laptop computers to access a dedicated telemedicine platform, which also provided functionalities for neurological assessment, electronic reporting and prehospital notification of the in-hospital team. Key registrations included any safety issue, mobile connectivity, communication of patient information, audiovisual quality, user-friendliness and accuracy of the prehospital diagnosis.      Results   Prehospital teleconsultation was obtained in 41 out of 43 cases (95.3\%). The success rates for communication of blood pressure, heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, glycemia, and electronic patient identification were 78.7\%, 84.8\%, 80.6\%, 64.0\%, and 84.2\%. A preliminary prehospital diagnosis was formulated in 90.2\%, with satisfactory agreement with final in-hospital diagnoses. Communication of a prehospital report to the in-hospital team was successful in 94.7\% and prenotification of the in-hospital team via SMS in 90.2\%. Failures resulted mainly from limited mobile connectivity and to a lesser extent from software, hardware or human error. The user acceptance was high.      Conclusions   Ambulance-based telemedicine of the third generation is safe, feasible and reliable but further research and development, especially with regard to high speed broadband access, is needed before this approach can be implemented in daily practice.},

	abstract = {Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a severe disease that has been endemic in north-east Italy since 1992. Over the past two decades, there has been an increase in the number of human cases reported in many European countries, including Italy. To assess the current TBE infection risk, questing ticks were collected from known TBE foci, as well as from a site in northern Italy where no human infections have been reported previously. A total of 1739 Ixodes ricinus (1485 nymphs and 254 adults) was collected and analysed for TBEV prevalence by a real-time RT-PCR targeting the 3' untranslated region. Phylogenetic analyses of the partial envelope gene were conducted on two newly sequenced TBE virus (TBEV) strains and 28 previously published sequences to investigate the genealogical relationships of the circulating TBEV strains. These phylogenetic analyses confirmed a previous report that the European TBEV subtype is the only subtype circulating within the TBE foci in north-east Italy. Interestingly, nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a high degree of divergence (mean 2.54 \%) between the TBEV strains recovered in the Italian province of Trento, despite the circulation of a single TBEV subtype. This elevated genetic variability within a single TBE focus may reflect local differences in the long-standing evolutionary dynamics of TBEV at this site relative to previously characterized sites, or more recent and continuous reintroduction of various TBEV strains.},

OBJECTIVES: To review controlled trials assessing the effects of computerized clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) and to identify study characteristics predicting benefit.
DATA SOURCES: We updated our earlier reviews by searching the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Inspec, and ISI databases and consulting reference lists through September 2004. Authors of 64 primary studies confirmed data or provided additional information.
STUDY SELECTION: We included randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials that evaluated the effect of a CDSS compared with care provided without a CDSS on practitioner performance or patient outcomes.
DATA EXTRACTION: Teams of 2 reviewers independently abstracted data on methods, setting, CDSS and patient characteristics, and outcomes.
DATA SYNTHESIS: One hundred studies met our inclusion criteria. The number and methodologic quality of studies improved over time. The CDSS improved practitioner performance in 62 (64\%) of the 97 studies assessing this outcome, including 4 (40\%) of 10 diagnostic systems, 16 (76\%) of 21 reminder systems, 23 (62\%) of 37 disease management systems, and 19 (66\%) of 29 drug-dosing or prescribing systems. Fifty-two trials assessed 1 or more patient outcomes, of which 7 trials (13\%) reported improvements. Improved practitioner performance was associated with CDSSs that automatically prompted users compared with requiring users to activate the system (success in 73\% of trials vs 47\%; P = .02) and studies in which the authors also developed the CDSS software compared with studies in which the authors were not the developers (74\% success vs 28\%; respectively, P = .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Many CDSSs improve practitioner performance. To date, the effects on patient outcomes remain understudied and, when studied, inconsistent.},

disease vectors like mosquitoes and rodents as well as rise in water-borne illnesses like
cholera and other enteric diseases. Our paper is based on the concept that a multidisciplinary
informatics scaffold can serve as an Early Warning and Automated Response System
(EWARS) for a variety of communicable diseases. It will utilize multiple information
resources including Remote Sensing (RS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for exposure assessment (John et al 2004). Early
warning systems are not new (Witt et al 2009). However, what is novel in the proposal is
the integration of an adaptive Fuzzy Logic Decision Support System to the early warning
component being developed by the investigative team. It also markedly differs from
other efforts to provide decision-support in the unique degree of detail and process guidance
delivered as well as in the broad multidisciplinary nature of the study group. Use of
such a system would enable prophylactic public health interventions to be rapidly deployed
based on a real-time, scientifically-based assessment of the threat environment.
Particular attention would be paid to environmental factors amenable to corrective interventions.
The informatics component of the system would be based on open source software,
and the software developed during this project will also be in the open source domain.
The project is multinational and multidisciplinary.},

In Europe, LB is caused by infection with one or more pathogenic European genospecies of the spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, mainly transmitted by the tick Ixodes ricinus. Recent surveys show that the overall prevalence of LB may be stabilising, but its geographical distribution is increasing. In addition, much remains to be discovered about the factors affecting genospecific prevalence, transmission and virulence, although avoidance of tick bite still appears to be the most efficient preventive measure. Uniform, European-wide surveillance programmes (particularly on a local scale) and standardisation of diagnostic tests and treatments are still urgently needed, especially in the light of climate change scenarios and land-use and socio-economic changes. Improved epidemiological knowledge will also aid development of more accurate risk prediction models for LB. Studies on the effects of biodiversity loss and ecosystem changes on LB emergence may identify new paradigms for the prevention and control of LB and other tick-borne diseases.},

	abstract = {Objective
To examine adoption of telehealth in a rural public health district and to explain how the innovation became sustainable.

Study Setting
Longitudinal, qualitative study (1988–2008) of the largest public health district in Georgia.

Study Design
Case study design provided deep insights into the innovation's social dynamics. Punctuated equilibrium theory helped present and make sense of the process. We identified antecedent conditions and outcomes, and we distinguished between episodes and encounters based on the disruptive effects of events.

Data Collection
Twenty-five semistructured interviews with 19 decision makers and professionals, direct observations, published papers, grant proposals, technical specifications, and other written materials.

Principal Findings
Strong collaboration within the district, with local community, and with external partners energized the process. Well-functioning outreach clinics made telehealth desirable. Local champions cultivated participation and generative capability, and overcame barriers through opportunistic exploitation of technological and financial options. Telehealth usage fluctuated between medical and administrative operations in response to internal needs and contextual dynamics. External agencies provided initial funding and supported later expansion.

Conclusions
Extensive internal and external collaboration, and a combination of technology push and opportunistic exploitation, can enable sustainable rural telehealth innovation.},

Harvesting records of rock partridge (Alectoris graeca saxatilis) were examined first to identify the presence of cycles in a species with a southern European distribution and then to examine synchrony between populations at a range of scales. 2. Hunting records from 1965 to 1994 were obtained from 210 hunting areas and analysed at three spatial scales: subpopulation, population and metapopulation. Rock partridge exhibited cyclic fluctuations in about 40\% of the time series with a period of 4-7 years. The results did not change with spatial scale. The density-dependent structure of the populations showed that most populations exhibited damped oscillations. 3. The proportion of populations that were in synchrony increased with scale from the population to metapopulation level. There was no decline in synchrony with distance but a large variation between populations irrespective of distance. 4. The populations clustered into dry and wet habitats, with those in the dry habitat being more cyclic. We suggest the lack of spatial synchrony with distance but greater synchrony within habitats may reflect the influence of stochastic events operating on populations with different density dependence structures.},

In order to predict the highest risk areas for increased TBE virus activity, we have combined cross-sectional serological data, obtained from 459 domestic goats, with analysis of the autumnal cooling rate based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) data. A significant relationship between finding antibodies against the virus in serum (seroprevalence) in goats and the autumnal cooling rate was detected, indicating that the transmission intensity of the virus does not only vary spatially, but also in relation to climatic factors. Virus seroprevalence in goats was correlated with the occurrence of TBE in humans and also with the average number of forestry workers' tick bites, demonstrating that serological screening of domestic animals, combined with an analysis of the autumnal cooling rate, can be used as early-warning predictors of TBE risk in humans.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE Foundry is an industry involved various kinds of metals and chemicals. Workers who work in foundry industry are at risk of exposure to these metals and chemicals. Objective of this study was to conduct quantitative health risk assessment for workers who exposed to metals from an aluminium production industry. MATERIAL AND METHOD The U.S. National Academy of Sciences' four steps of health risk assessment were used to conduct quantitative health risk assessment in this study. RESULTS This study showed that there were 6 types of metals involved in the aluminium foundry in this study. These metals could cause various health effects but not cancers. Workers were mostly exposed to these metals by inhalation. Calculated reference dose (RfD) for inhalation of aluminium used in this assessment was 0.000015 mg/kg/day. Calculated RID for inhalation of manganese used in this assessment was 0.000002 mg/kg/day. Calculated RfD for inhalation of copper used in this assessment was 0.000028 mg/kg/day. Calculated RID for inhalation of zinc used in this assessment was 0.000083 mg/ kg/day. Calculated RID for inhalation of magnesium used in this assessment was 0.949833 mg/kg/day. Calculated RID for inhalation of iron used in this assessment was 10.6219 mg/kg/day. Maximum daily doses (MDDs) for workers who exposed to metals measured in this foundry were 0, 0, 0.000463, 0.0000927, 0.000162 and 0 mg/kg/day for manganese, zinc, aluminium, iron, magnesium and copper, respectively. Finally, risk characterization for workers exposed to metals in this aluminium foundry showed that workers in this foundry had 31 times higher risk of developing diseases from aluminium than persons who were not exposed to aluminium. These workers had the same risk of developing diseases from other metals and chemicals as persons who were not exposed to those metals and chemicals. CONCLUSION Workers who exposed to aluminium in this aluminium production plant had 31 times risk of developing non-carcinogenic effects from aluminium compared with normal persons. Therefore, appropriate preventive measures should be applied to protect workers.},

Using chikungunya virus (CHIKV) to study adaptation to a mosquito vector, we evaluated mutations associated with recently evolved sub-lineages. Multiple Aedes albopictus-adaptive fitness peaks became available after CHIKV acquired an initial adaptive (E1-A226V) substitution, permitting rapid lineage diversification observed in nature. All second-step mutations involved replacements by glutamine or glutamic acid of E2 glycoprotein amino acids in the acid-sensitive region, providing a framework to anticipate additional A. albopictus-adaptive mutations. The combination of second-step adaptive mutations into a single, 'super-adaptive' fitness peak also predicted the future emergence of CHIKV strains with even greater transmission efficiency in some current regions of endemic circulation, followed by their likely global spread.},

We aggregated these LST maps over time and identified the potential distribution areas of Ae. albopictus by adapting published temperature threshold values using three variables as predictors (0 degree C for mean January temperatures, 11 degree C for annual mean temperatures and 1350 growing degree days filtered for areas with autumnal mean temperatures {\textgreater} 11 degree C ). The resulting maps were integrated into the final potential distribution map and this was compared with the known current distribution of Ae. albopictus in north-eastern Italy.RESULTS:LST maps show the microclimatic characteristics peculiar to complex terrains, which would not be visible in maps commonly derived from interpolated meteorological station data. The patterns of the three indicator variables partially differ from each other, while winter temperature is the determining limiting factor for the distribution of Ae. albopictus. All three variables show a similar spatial pattern with some local differences, in particular in the northern part of the study area (upper Adige valley).CONCLUSIONS:Reconstructed daily land surface temperature data from satellites can be used to predict areas of short term invasion of the tiger mosquito with sufficient accuracy (200 m pixel resolution size). Furthermore, they may be applied to other species of arthropod of medical interest for which temperature is a relevant limiting factor. The results indicate that, during the next few years, the tiger mosquito will probably spread toward northern latitudes and higher altitudes in north-eastern Italy, which will considerably expand the range of the current distribution of this species.},

Characteristics of the concept were analysed and compared with those of current animal health care strategies for disease risk identification and herd health management, insurance, and certification. HACCP is a hybrid strategy of quality control at both production process and product level. Animal health is considered a particular quality feature. We show that process control (expressed in terms of controlling both general and specific disease risk factors) and product control (expressed in terms of testing animals or animal products for specific disease agents) could form the basis for improving animal health. We conclude that HACCP provides ample opportunity for preventive health action and risk management at a relatively low cost in terms of labour, finance and documentation expenditure, at both the farm and sector level. Epidemiological field studies are currently needed to identify critical control points and to design HACCP procedures for livestock producers. In the long run, HACCP based animal health care can be further developed into a quality control systems approach to cover all aspects that are related, either directly or indirectly, to animal health.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
Decision Support Systems (DSS) are considered innovative tools to cope with climate change related issues and support decision-makers in a sustainable management of natural resources and in the implementation of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) and adaptation plans. Involving DSS end users since the beginning of the development of a DSS is recognised as fundamental in order to design a tool that can meet stakeholders needs. However, from the analysis of the risk based DSSs at the regional and/or local scale, emerges a lack of application of participatory approaches, despite their acknowledged relevance to the current scientific literature and regulations. 
 
Accordingly, in order to respond to the needs of the DSS end users (i.e. public institutions dealing with coastal management and administration), the main aim of this paper is the development of a participative approach for a DSS named DESYCO, aimed at the assessment of climate change related impacts and risks on natural and human systems. 
 
The participative approach was carried out by means of the integration of participative moments in the DESYCO framework, the identification of potential end users through a preliminary stakeholder analysis and finally the design, administration and analysis of a questionnaire addressed to the end users identified in the case study area of the North Adriatic Italian coast. 
 
37 potential DSS end users for the case study were identified and addressed by a survey investigating their knowledge about climate change impacts on coastal zone, ICZM strategy and implementation, DSS functionalities. 
 
The questionnaire allowed to gain information that both confirmed the validity of the methodology choices of DESYCO and supplied some useful contribution to the selection of further stakeholders. From the results it emerges a lack of knowledge about ICZM and climate change issues. Moreover public institutions ask for short time frame hazard scenarios while the DSS, depending on the available information supplied by models, focuses especially on long term scenarios.},

The worldwide rise in the number of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and consequent end-stage renal failure necessitating renal replacement therapy is threatening to reach epidemic proportions over the next decade, and only a small number of countries have robust economies able to meet the challenges posed. A change in global approach to CKD from treatment of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to much more aggressive primary and secondary prevention is therefore imperative. In this Seminar, we examine the epidemiology of CKD worldwide, with emphasis on early detection and prevention, and the feasibility of methods for detection and primary prevention of CKD. We also review the risk factors and markers of progressive CKD. We explore current understanding of the mechanisms underlying renal scarring leading to ESRD to inform on current and future interventions as well as evidence relating to interventions to slow the progression of CKD. Finally, we make strategic recommendations based on future research to stem the worldwide growth of CKD. Consideration is given to health economics. A global and concerted approach to CKD must be adopted in both more and less developed countries to avoid a major catastrophe.},

Pesticide poisoning is a significant problem in developing countries primarily because of unsafe pesticide application and handling practices. Safety is further exacerbated by the illiteracy and poverty that prevails in most farming communities of developing countries. Pesticides classified as being extremely or highly hazardous by FAO and WHO, including those banned by other countries, continue to be used in developing countries. Many farmers in developing countries continue to be exposed to pesticides from either storing them in or near their residences, or from inadequate or unsafe application or handling practices. Farming populations exposed to pesticides suffer from several health problems, primarily neurological abnormalities, respiratory ailments, and reproductive, endocrinological, and dermal problems. In developing countries, the scientific literature (including the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, India) have taken the initiative to monitor health problems resulting from pesticide exposure in agrarian communities. The welfare fund for agricultural laborers could institute a special program for pesticide applicators in developing countries. The primary need, currently, in such countries is creation and implementation of sound national policies to effectively articulate appropriate guidelines for managing farm pest control activities. Such policies should be aimed at both limiting pesticide exposure and usage, but doing so without damaging the yields of food production. If such steps are taken, it is fully expected that the incidence of adverse health consequences for agrarian populations from pesticide toxicity will decrease, and the health of farmers improve.},

We analyzed pesticide use and poisoning in Central America, particularly in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and evaluated whether registration decisions are based on such data, in accordance with the FAO Code. Extensive use of very hazardous pesticides continues in Central America and so do poisonings with organophosphates, carbamates, endosulfan and paraquat as the main causative agents. Central American governments do not carry out or commission scientific risk assessments. Instead, guidelines from international agencies are followed for risk management through the registration process. Documentation of pesticide poisonings during several decades never induced any decision to ban or restrict a pesticide. However, based on the official surveillance systems, in 2000, the ministers of health of the seven Central American countries agreed to ban or restrict twelve of these pesticides. Now, almost 4 years later, restrictions have been implemented in El Salvador and in Nicaragua public debate is ongoing. Chemical and agricultural industries do not withdraw problematic pesticides voluntarily. In conclusion, the registration processes in Central America do not comply satisfactorily with the FAO Code. However, international regulatory guidelines are important in developing countries, and international agencies should strongly extend its scope and influence, limiting industry involvement. Profound changes in international and national agricultural policies, steering towards sustainable agriculture based on non-chemical pest management, are the only way to reduce poisonings.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive analytical review of the risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication approaches currently being undertaken by key national, provincial/state, territorial, and international agencies was conducted. The information acquired for review was used to identify the differences, commonalities, strengths, and weaknesses among the various approaches, and to identify elements that should be included in an effective, current, and comprehensive approach applicable to environmental, human health and occupational health risks. More than 80 agencies, organizations, and advisory councils, encompassing more than 100 risk documents, were examined during the period from February 2000 until November 2002. An overview was made of the most important general frameworks for risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication for human health and ecological risk, and for occupational health risk. In addition, frameworks for specific applications were reviewed and summarized, including those for (1)contaminated sites; (2) northern contaminants; (3) priority substances; (4) standards development; (5) food safety; (6) medical devices; (7) prescription drug use; (8) emergency response; (9) transportation; (10) risk communication. Twelve frameworks were selected for more extensive review on the basis of representation of the areas of human health, ecological, and occupational health risk; relevance to Canadian risk management needs; representation of comprehensive and well-defined approaches; generalizability with their risk areas; representation of "state of the art" in Canada, the United States, and/or internationally; and extent of usage of potential usage within Canada. These 12 frameworks were: 1. Framework for Environmental Health Risk Management (US Presidential/Congressional Commission on Risk Assessment and Risk Management, 1997). 2. Health Risk Determination: The Challenge of Health Protection (Health and Welfare Canada, 1990). 3. Health Canada Decision-Making Framework for Identifying, Assessing and Managing Health Risks (Health Canada, 2000). 4. Canadian Environmental Protection Act: Human Health Risk Assessment of Priority Substances(Health Canada, 1994). 5. CSA-Q8550 Risk Management: Guidelines for Decision-Makers (Canada Standards Association, 1997). 6. Risk Assessment in the Federal Government: Managing the Process (US National Research Council, 1983). 7. Understanding Risk: Informing Decisions in a Democratic Society (US National Research Council, 1996). 8. Environmental Health Risk Assessment (enHealth Council of Australia, 2002). 9. A Framework for Ecological Risk Assessment (CCME, 1996). 10. Ecological Risk Assessments of Priority Substances Under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (Environment Canada, 1996).11. Guidelines for Ecological Risk Assessment (US EPA, 1998b). 12. Proposed Model for Occupational Health Risk Assessment and Management (Rampal \& Sadhra, 1999). Based on the extensive review of these frameworks, seven key elements that should be included in a comprehensive framework for human health, ecological, and occupational risk assessment and management were identified: 1. Problem formulation stage. 2. Stakeholder involvement. 3. Communication. 4. Quantitative risk assessment components. 5. Iteration and evaluation. 6. Informed decision making. 7. Flexibility. On the basis of this overarching approach to risk management, the following "checklist" to ensure a good risk management decision is proposed: - Make sure you're solving the right problem. - Consider the problem and the risk within the full context of the situation, using a broad perspective. - Acknowledge, incorporate, and balance the multiple dimensions of risk. - Ensure the highest degree of reliability for all components of the risk management process. - Involve interested and effected parties from the outset of the process. - Commit to honest and open communication between all parties. - Employ continuous evaluation throughout the process (formative, process, and outcome evaluation), and be prepared to change the decision if new information becomes available. Comprehensive and sound principles are critical to providing structure and integrity to risk management frameworks. Guiding principles are intended to provide an ethical grounding for considering the many factors involved in risk management decision making. Ten principles are proposed to guide risk management decision making. The first four principles were adapted and modified from Hattis (1996) along with the addition of two more principles by Hrudey (2000). These have been supplemented by another four principles to make the 10 presented. The principles are based in fundamental ethical principles and values. These principles are intended to be aspirational rather than prescriptive--their application requires flexibility and practical judgement. Risk management is inherently a process in search of balance among competing interests and concerns. Each risk management decision will be "balancing act" of competing priorities, and trade-offs may sometimes have to be made between seemingly conflicting principles. The 10 decision-making principles, with the corresponding ethical principle in italics are: 1. Do more good than harm (beneficence, nonmalificence).- The ultimate goal of good risk management is to prevent or minimize risk, or to "do good" as much as possible. 2. Fair process of decision making (fairness, natural justice). - Risk management must be just, equitable, impartial, unbiased, dispassionate, and objective as far as possible given the circumstances of each situation. 3. Ensure an equitable distribution of risk (equity). - An equitable process of risk management would ensure fair outcomes and equal treatment of all concerned through an equal distribution of benefits and burdens (includes the concept of distributive justice, i.e., equal opportunities for all individuals). 4. Seek optimal use of limited risk management resources (utility). - Optimal risk management demands using limited resources where they will achieve the most risk reduction of overall benefit. 5. Promise no more risk management that can be delivered (honesty).- Unrealistic expectations of risk management can be avoided with honest and candid public accounting of what we know and don't know, and what we can and can't do using risk assessment and risk management. 6. Impose no more risk that you would tolerate yourself (the Golden Rule). - The Golden Rule is important in risk management because it forces decision makers to abandon complete detachment from their decisions so they may understand the perspectives of those affected. 7. Be cautious in the face of uncertainty ("better safe than sorry"). - Risk management must adopt a cautious approach when faced with a potentially serous risk, even if the evidence is uncertain. 8. Foster informed risk decision making for all stakeholders (autonomy). - Fostering autonomous decision making involves both providing people with the opportunity to participate, and full and honest disclosure of all the information required for informed decisions. 9. Risk management processes must be flexible and evolutionary to be open to new knowledge and understanding (evolution, evaluation, iterative process). - The incorporation of new evidence requires that risk management be a flexible, evolutionary, and iterative process, and that evaluation is employed at the beginning and througthout the process. 10. the complete elimination fo risk is not possible (life is not risk free).- Risk is pervasive in our society, and cannot be totally eliminated despite an oft-expressed public desire for "zero risk". However, the level of risk that may ve tolerable by any individual is dependent on values of beliefs, as well as scientific information. Each agency must continue to employ a process that meets the needs of their specific application of risk management. A single approach cannot satisfy the diverse areas to which risk decisions are being applied. However, with increasing experience in the application of the approaches, we are evolving to a common understanding of the essential elements and principles required for successful risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication. Risk management will continue to be a balancing act of competing priorities and needs. Flexibility and good judgement are ultimately the key to successfully making appropriate risk decisions.},

	abstract = {Geospatial (geographical) software systems (GIS) are used for creating, viewing, managing, analysing and utilising geospatial data. Geospatial data can include socioeconomic, environmental, geophysical, and technical data about the Earth and societal infrastructure and it is pivotal in environmental modelling and management (EMM). Desktop, web-based, and embedded geospatial systems have become an essential part of EMM, providing pre- or post-processing of geospatial data, analysis and visualisation of results or a graphical user interface (GUI). Many local, regional, national, and international efforts are underway to create geospatial data infrastructures and tools for viewing and using geospatial data. When environmental attribute data is linked to these infrastructures, powerful tools for environmental management are instantly created. The growing culture of free/libre and open source software (FOSS) provides an alternative approach to software development for the field of GIS (FOSS4G). To provide an overview of FOSS4G for EMM, we analyse platforms, software stacks, and EMM workflows. In the FOSS world the barriers to interoperability are low and thus the software stack tends to be thicker than in the proprietary platform. The FOSS4G world thrives on the evolution of software stacks and platforms. We provide examples of software stacks built from current FOSS4G that support EMM workflows and highlight the advantages of FOSS4G solutions including opportunities to redistribute resulting modelling tools freely to end-users and to support general goals of openness and transparency with respect to modelling tools.},

	abstract = {The rapid propagation of vector-borne diseases, such as dengue fever, poses a threat to vulnerable populations, especially those in tropical regions. Prompt space-time analyses are critical elements for accurate outbreak detection and mitigation purposes. Open access web-based geospatial tools are particularly critical in developing countries lacking GIS software and expertise. Currently, online geospatial tools for the monitoring of surveillance data are confined to the mapping of aggregated data. In this paper, we present a web-based geospatial toolkit with a user-friendly interactive interface for the monitoring of dengue fever outbreaks, in space and time. Our geospatial toolkit is designed around the integration of (1) a spatial data management module in which epidemiologists upload spatio-temporal explicit data, (2) an analytical module running an accelerated Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to map the outbreaks of dengue fever, (3) a spatial database module to extract pairs of disease events close in space and time and (4) a GIS mapping module to visualize space-time linkages of pairs of disease events. We illustrate our approach on a set of dengue fever cases which occurred in Cali (659 geocoded cases), an urban environment in Colombia. Results indicate that dengue fever cases are significantly clustered, but the degree of intensity varies across the city. The design and implementation of the on-line toolkit underscores the benefits of the approach to monitor vector-borne disease outbreaks in a timely manner and at different scales, facilitating the appropriate allocation of resources. The toolkit is designed collaboratively with health epidemiologists and is portable for other surveillance data at the individual level such as crime or traffic accidents.},

Neutralization specificity for WNV antibodies was confirmed on an additional 34 sera that were tested in parallel against WNV (16/34 seropositivity), Usutu virus (3/34 seropositivity) and Koutango virus. The geometric mean neutralizing titre (GMT) calculated for WN-specific antibodies was 33.68 and did not differ significantly amongst sample sites, although the overall results indicate more active circulation of WNV at the higher elevations. Such high levels of seroconversion raise the possibility that many chickens may have been exposed to virus via routes other than mosquito transmission. No chickens or any other local animals were associated with illness due to WNV implying that WNV, and to a much lower extent Usutu virus, circulate harmlessly amongst wildlife species in northern Italy from late May onwards until early autumn.},
