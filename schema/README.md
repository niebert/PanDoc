# JSON Schema
This folder contains files that define a JSON schema. A JSON schema defines an expected structure of a JSON and the JSON schema is used to validate a JSON. This mechanism is especially useful to check a JSON prior to submission to a server. In consequence pre-check of JSON can reduced client server communication due to invalid JSON structure significantly (see e.g. the [definition of JSON schema](https://github.com/jdorn/json-editor/blob/master/examples/basic.html) in the [JSON editor of Jeremy Dorn](https://github.com/jdorn/json-editor) .
